The tools and program included in this package are designed and distributed for the evaluation of the intelligibility of enhanced speech processed by nonlinear algorithms. 
This program can be used only for evaluation purpose. Please refer to the license file for details.

Before starting, please read carefully the license file and the following,
   - The package includes a MATLAB code version of the GEDI/mr-GEDI algorithm (GEDI_OutdcGC.m/mr-GEDI_OutdcGC.m and GEDI.m/mr-GEDI.m) .
   - To run MATLAB files, you need the signal processing toolbox.
   - Note that Wakayama Univ. and NTT may stop releasing this code at any time without prior notice.

In this package you will find the following
   (1) The license file (License.txt)
   (2) A MATLAB version of the GEDI/mr-GEDI algorithms (GEDI.m, mrGEDI.m, GEDI_OutdcGC.m, and mrGEDI_OutdcGC.m) and the frame-based version (mrGEDIfb.m and mrGEDI_OutdcGCfb.m)
   (3) A sample script describing how to use  (test_GEDI.m, test_mrGEDI.m, and test_mrGEDIfb.m)
   (4) Please download the package of the dynamic compressive gammachirp filterbank (dcGC-FB) and put it under "package/" directory. "package/GCFBv211pack/"  is for original GEDI/mrGEDI. "package/GCFBv221pack/"  is for mrGEDIfb.
   (5) Sample data in wav_sample/sample_sp1.wav ~ wav_sample/sample_sp4.wav, and wav_sample/sample_sp_clean.wav

-	GCFBv211pack and GCFBv221pack are Matlab packages of the dynamic compressive gammachirp filterbank. 
-	test_GEDI.m, GEDI.m, and GEDI_OutdcGC.m are Matlab codes for the gammachirp envelope distortion index (GEDI). These calculate speech intelligibility of noisy/enhanced speech sounds. GCFBv211pack is necessary. Execute test_GEDI.m first to learn the codes.
-	test_mrGEDI.m, mrGEDI.m, and mrGEDI_OutdcGC.m are Matlab codes for the "multi-resolution" gammachirp envelope distortion index (mrGEDI). These calculate speech intelligibility of noisy/enhanced speech sounds. GCFBv211pack is necessary. Execute test_mrGEDI.m first to learn the codes.
-	test_mrGEDIfb.m, mrGEDIfb.m, and mrGEDIfb_OutdcGC.m are Matlab codes for frame-based mrGEDI. These calculate speech intelligibility of noisy/enhanced speech sounds sufficiently fast. GCFBv221pack is necessary. Execute test_mrGEDIfb.m first to learn the codes.
-	The files in wav_sample are example sound files of noisy speech a clean speech reference and noisy speeches.

The tools and program included in this package are designed and distributed for the evaluation of the intelligibility of enhanced speech processed by nonlinear algorithms. 
This program can be used only for evaluation purpose. Please refer to the license file for details.

Before starting, please read carefully the license file and the following,
   - The package includes a MATLAB code version of the GEDI/mr-GEDI algorithm (GEDI_OutdcGC.m/mr-GEDI_OutdcGC.m and GEDI.m/mr-GEDI.m) .
   - To run MATLAB files, you need the signal processing toolbox.
   - Note that Wakayama Univ. and NTT may stop releasing this code at any time without prior notice.

In this package you will find the following
   (1) The license file (license.txt)
   (2) A MATLAB version of the GEDI/mr-GEDI algorithm (GEDI_OutdcGC.m/mr-GEDI_OutdcGC.m and GEDI.m/mr-GEDI.m).
   (3) A sample script describing how to use wpe.p (test_GEDI.m and test_mrGEDI.m)
   (4) Please download the package of the dynamic compressive gammachirp filterbank (dcGC-FB) and locate it into “thirdparty” directoly. 
   (5) Sample data in wav_sample/sample_sp1.wav ~ wav_sample/sample_sp4.wav, and wav_sample/sample_sp_clean.wav
